# Ameek Bhalla's Résumé

This repository is meant to host three versions of my résumés. They are described below next to checkboxes indicating their completion status: 
1. [x] [default-style.pdf](https://github.com/ameekbhalla/cv/blob/master/default-style/default-style.pdf) made with the [pagedown package](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)—cluttered and tedious to read.
2. [x] [typographic-style.pdf](https://github.com/ameekbhalla/cv/blob/master/typographic-style/typographic-style.pdf) made with the LaTeX template [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/blob/master/examples/template.tex)—conforming to [rules of good typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html).
3. [ ] A CV containing more details than either of the two résumés.
