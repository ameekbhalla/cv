# Ameek Bhalla's Résumé

This repository is meant to host three versions of my résumés, as described below along with their completion status: 
1. [x] [default-style.pdf](https://github.com/ameekbhalla/cv/blob/master/default-style.pdf)—made with the [pagedown package](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)—cluttered and tedious to read.
2. [ ] typographic-style.pdf—made with the [vitae package](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae)—conforming to [rules of good typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html).
3. [ ] A CV containing more details than either of the two résumés.
