This repository is meant to host résumés made with the R package [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

There should be three versions at the completion of this project:
1. A résumé named 'default-style', made with minimal changes to the template provided by pagedown package: cluttered and difficult to read.
2. A résumé named 'typographic-style' adhering to stylistic rules recommended in [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html): uncluttered and easy to read.
3. A CV containing more details than either résumé.
