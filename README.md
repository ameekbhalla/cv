This repository is meant to host multiple versions of my résumés made with the R package [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

There should be three versions at the completion of this project:
1. A résumé named 'default-style' made with minimal changes to the template provided by pagedown—<br />cluttered and tedious to read.
2. A résumé named 'typographic-style' adhering to rules recommended in [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html)—<br />uncluttered and easy to read.
3. A CV containing more details than either résumé version.
