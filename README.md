# Ameek Bhalla's Résumé

This repository is meant to host three versions of my résumés. They are described below next to checkboxes indicating their completion status: 
1. [x] The folder 'default-style' containes my résumé as made with the [pagedown package](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).
   It's cluttered and tedious to read.
3. [x] The folder 'typographic-style' contains my résumé as made with the LaTeX template [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv/blob/master/examples/template.tex). 
   It conforms to [rules of good typography](https://practicaltypography.com/resumes.html).
4. [ ] The folder 'CV'—it contains a CV which has more details than either of the two résumés.
